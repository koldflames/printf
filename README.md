THIS IS A GROUP PROJECT FOR ALX COHORT 12

In this project, we were required to creata our own printf function which will do exactly what the normal printf function does.

Some of the requirements for the project are:
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h
- Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded
- Note that we will not provide the putchar function for this project.


Compilation:
The code should be compiled this way:
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c
